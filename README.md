### **Features**

**EasyBackUp**

Backs up your server folders into classic `.zip` files, organizing them into separate directories within `plugin/EasyBackUp` based on the backed-up folders. You can customize:

- Backup interval
    
- Maximum number of backups stored (oldest backups are automatically deleted when the limit is exceeded).
    

### **Setup Guide**

1. Download the `.jar` file from the GitHub link at the top of the post.
    
2. Simply place `EasyBackUp.jar` into your server’s `plugins` folder.
    
3. Start your server. By default, it backs up the `world` folder, but you can customize this to include other folders as needed.
    
4. After the first launch, check the config file and restart the server if you make changes.
    
5. Verify in the server logs that the configuration updates are applied correctly.
    
6. Done!
